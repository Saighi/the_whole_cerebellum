Using sparse matrix from scipy should be more efficient 07/13

Equation parrallel fibers plasticity 07/13 :

w = w + (gc_activity+cb_activity)*(switch)

with switch = -1 if:
    gc_activity+cb_activity>threshold
else switch = 1

Change plasticity rule, every synapse at zero are then ignored ..

Maybe just change how we deal with synapses overall !

The simpler case to verigy will be very dense connectivity with uniform activity from pontine.
What I expect to see is oscillation of the synaptic weights and of the IO activity around the threshold value.
Then slowly sparsify the connectivity until abnormal state is produced with divergence of activity/weights.
Divergence of activity/weights shoul signify that somme neurons/synapses are not able to safely take part of 
the homeostatic loop/mechanism. 

If the amount of intracellular calcium is propotional to the GC_PC weights, we can get a self stabilieing mechanism.
But do we want ?


La capacité à résoudre précisément des mismatch DCN-IO émerge de la spécificité de l'origine du signal inhibiteur pouvant résoudre ce mismatch. 
L'activation d'un petite sous population des granule cells et donc d'une petite sous population de des purkinje cells permet d'induire une plasticité ciblé 
menant 

To simplify the complexity of the input of each neuronal population we can take the n most activated units and put them to one.
Such as n is a number that allow the reaching and the solving of the IO activity induced by the mismatch.
